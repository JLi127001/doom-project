Using Unity 2022.3.21f1 (Same as homework)

# High level description
Doom/Quake-inspired arena shooter set in a post-apocalyptic CSE2 building, where the enemies are bugs. We are going to use pixel art for the walls, guns, pickups, and enemies. The final boss will be a 3-d bug mascot that has animations. We have one big level that leads to a final boss. In the main level, you explore the cse2 building, collect key cards, collect ammo, and shoot the enemies (computer bugs) with debugging tools (the weapons). The enemies have projectiles.

# Checkpoint
We will have movement, a weapon, some pickups, and (maybe) a door. This will be on a flat plane for the checkpoint. Some textures on the walls as well. Some animation assets will be done as well.

# Key Risks and Mitigations
Implement movement first so we can build up the rest of the game, but we mitigate this by doing it early in the development process
Learning animation (particularly in 3D) will be a learning curve. Will watch tutorials. 
Physics engine and simulations could potentially be difficult - any advanced physics can fallback to Unity’s built-in physics
Some gun ideas may be difficult to implement - we have tutorials for most of these, and we plan to cut and replace any guns that are too difficult to implement
Rocket launcher can be tricky with unique projectile physics and explosion
Flamethrower could be a difficult idea
Movement camera bob can be difficult to figure out - we have tutorials for this as well, and can implement a basic sinusoid movement pattern if other things fail
